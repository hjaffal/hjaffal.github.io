**About Me**

With 17 years of experience in software development and product innovation, I currently lead Amazon's Data Services team for Security and Loss Prevention (S&LP) in Luxembourg. My work focuses on harnessing data analytics, AI, and machine learning to protect Amazon's operations and secure the supply chain from end to end. My team is dedicated to delivering insights and solutions that proactively address security risks, reduce losses, and enhance the customer experience.

### My story
My professional journey has taken me across diverse roles and industries. I served as Chief Product Officer at Nabed, a health-tech platform transforming educational services across the Middle East. Before that, I was a Senior Product and Program Manager at ArabiaGIS in Beirut, where I led innovative, mission-driven initiatives. Some of my key accomplishments include launching "Tahaki," a cloud-based platform for NGO monitoring and evaluation, and managing groundbreaking projects that seamlessly blended technology with social impact. My career has always been driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to creating meaningful solutions.
### Get Engaged
Beyond my career, I am passionate about supporting NGOs. I volunteer my expertise to help organizations leverage technology for greater social good.
